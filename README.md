# BDoor — Fivem Backdoor


## Introduction
I was bored and wanted to learn Express.js, so I decided to work on a fun test project. That’s how I ended up creating "FiveM Backdoor" a project built purely for learning and experimentation.


# Setup

1. Change credentials in index.js
2. Start server
3. Go into finish.lua and change the server ip
4. Spread it :pray:
5. Boom!
